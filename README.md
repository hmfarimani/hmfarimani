👋 Hi there! I’m @hmfarimani, an AI and programming enthusiast.
👀 I’m passionate about Robotics, AI, Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, and Deep Learning.
💻 I began as a full-stack web developer, especially in the .NET ecosystem. Then I became a robotics enthusiast after building a teleoperation platform for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs).
🔬 Now, I’m researching trustworthy AI and safe robotics, combining formal verification with learning-based methods.
🌱 Currently, I'm working on mobile robot navigation.
🤝 I’m eager to collaborate on multi-disciplinary projects at the intersection of AI and real-world impact.
