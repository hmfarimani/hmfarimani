👋 Hi there! I’m @hmfarimani, an AI and programming enthusiast.

👀 I'm passionate about Robotics, AI, Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, and Deep Learning.

💻 I started as a full-stack web developer, primarily using the .NET ecosystem. Later, I became a robotics enthusiast after building a teleoperation platform for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs).

🔬 Currently, I’m a Graduate Research Assistant, working on trustworthy AI, formal verification, and safe robotics.

🌱 I’m actively learning and researching mobile robot navigation, trustworthy AI and safe robotics, combining formal verification with learning-based methods.

🤝 I’m always open to collaborating on multi-disciplinary projects where AI can help solve meaningful, real-world problems.
